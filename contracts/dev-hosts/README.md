# Development Host Adapters

This directory holds versioned host adapter contracts for repository development sessions.

It exists to keep host/runtime differences out of the product-facing runtime contract and out of machine-specific local overlays.

## Layers

Use the following layering model:

1. Root repository development contract: `AGENTS.md`
2. Host adapter contract from this directory
3. Product/runtime service contract: `contracts/redcube-runtime-service/AGENTS.md`
4. Optional local-only overlay: `.omx/local/AGENTS.local.md`

## Files

- `omx-cli.md`: host behavior when the session is running under OMX CLI/runtime
- `codex-app.md`: host behavior when the session is running in Codex App or plain Codex without OMX runtime

## Local Overlay Convention

Machine-specific paths, personal shell workflow, private launch hints, and other non-portable guidance belong in:

`.omx/local/AGENTS.local.md`

That file must stay untracked.

## Portability Rule

Keep this directory reusable across repositories that share the same development workflow.
Host adapter contracts may describe execution surfaces and activation gates, but they must not redefine product/runtime truth.
